# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

**m.** — A personal lab for AI agents, prototypes, and consulting work. Ideas become things here. Some finished, some rough, all real.

## Philosophy

- Problem first, then craft
- From idea to action
- Warm, human, unpretentious
- The signature is small because the work speaks

## The Signature

"m." appears quietly — in a footer, an about screen, wherever feels natural. It adapts to each project's design language. Always lowercase, always with the period. Final, but not loud.

## Design Standards

When building frontends, avoid generic AI aesthetics:
- No overused fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- No clichéd color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- No predictable layouts

Instead: commit to a bold aesthetic direction, use distinctive typography, and create memorable visual experiences. See `.claude/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md` for detailed guidelines.
