One. The primary goal of this home page is to showcase my creative and technical side by highlighting the projects I've worked on. These projects will range from creating an AI agent to creating a prototype. The idea is to create a lab to showcase this, helping him with one aspect of consulting leads or attracting collaborators or portfolio showcase. That's why I wanted to adopt a more minimalist aesthetic because I wanted the work to speak for itself.
Two. Yes, visitors should be able to browse the actual projects I've built, but I think that's going to come later once I have them. For now, this is more like a scaffolding mood philosophy page just to get the overall idea done.
Three. Yeah, I mean, I think there should be. I don't know, what do you think based on what I've said before?
Four. I don't have any projects yet. It's just kind of trying to get behind the vision of what I'm trying to do, just so I know what I can work towards.
Five. I think M is intentionally anonymous and mysterious. I also was thinking of m-labs. But yeah, the idea is also focused on the minimal side and really letting the projects and aesthetics and sort of designed speak for themselves.
6. I'm open to any sort of design, I don't know, thing that would go with the philosophy.
7. Yeah, I'm open to the widely different directions just to see what we can come up with that would try to go with this aesthetic.
8. There's not anything that must appear. This is more of a creative sort of task. And I just want to see what kind of variations we come up with.
