m.
A personal lab for building out ideas. Some finished, some rough, all real.
What it is:
m. is where ideas become things. Apps, tools, experiments — whatever needs to exist. The work ranges from polished to raw, like pages in a sketchbook. Not everything ships. Not everything needs to.
Philosophy:

Problem first, then craft
From idea to action
Warm, human, unpretentious
The signature is small because the work speaks

The signature:
"m." appears quietly — in a footer, an about screen, wherever feels natural. It adapts to each project's design language. Always lowercase, always with the period. Final, but not loud.
