## What Makes It Work

### 1. Confidence Through Restraint

- Almost no explanatory copy on homepage
- No "we are a passionate team" filler
- The work is the pitch — nothing else competes for attention

### 2. Credibility Through Association

- Luxury fashion clients shown immediately (Gucci, Stella McCartney, Dunhill, JW Anderson)
- Portfolio as proof of capability
- No need to explain quality — the brands do that

### 3. Clear Positioning

One sentence. No buzzwords. Instantly understood:
> "A global experience studio at the intersection of contemporary design, fashion and events"

### 4. Visual-First Hierarchy

- Homepage dominated by slow image slider (2.5s per frame)
- Forces visitors to *look* rather than read
- Mirrors how their actual work functions — spatial, experiential, immersive

### 5. Subtle Craft Details

- Multi-language support (international luxury market)
- Multiple image resolutions (performance-conscious)
- Careful CMS naming conventions (lowercase clients, uppercase projects)

## The Pattern: "Portfolio as Proof"

No selling. No explaining. The assumption is: if you're the right client, you already know what you're looking at.

This filters through confidence. The site doesn't try to convince — it presents, and lets the work do the rest.

## Takeaways for Future Projects

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Let work speak | Minimize explanatory copy when portfolio is strong |
| Association over explanation | Show who you've worked with, not what you do |
| Slow reveals | Don't rush the user — controlled pacing builds presence |
| Single-sentence positioning | If you can't say it in one line, you don't know what you do |
| Visual dominance | For creative work, images > words |
