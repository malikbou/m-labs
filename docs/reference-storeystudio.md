## What Makes It Work

### 1. Discipline as Identity

Homepage leads with "SPATIAL DESIGN" — not a tagline, but a classification. They define the category they operate in, not the benefits they offer.

### 2. Three-Word Navigation

Work. Profile. Contact. Nothing else. The restraint signals confidence and focus.

### 3. Visual-First, Text-Sparse

Portfolio is image-heavy with minimal project descriptions. The work explains itself through photography of the physical spaces.

### 4. Longevity Signals

- Hermès relationship spans 2016–2025 (9 years)
- Nike relationship spans 2014–2019 (5 years)
- Repeat clients throughout the portfolio

This communicates reliability without stating it.

### 5. Dual-City Positioning

"Based in London and Paris" — signals European luxury market fluency and international capability.

### 6. Philosophy Over Pitch

Profile page emphasizes approach ("sculpture, architecture, and narrative") rather than selling. They describe *how* they think, not why you should hire them.

---

## The Pattern: "Category Definition"

Storey doesn't compete within spatial design — they present themselves as *the* spatial design studio. The site structure, copy, and client list all reinforce a singular focus.

No diversification. No "we also do digital." Just spaces.

---

## Positioning Statement

> "Creating innovative spaces that surprise, engage, and encourage participation."

> "Blending sculpture, architecture, and narrative to shape meaningful sensory experiences."

## Takeaways for Future Projects

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Discipline as headline | Lead with what you do, not what you promise |
| Show longevity | Multi-year client relationships signal trust |
| Three-item nav | If you can't fit it in three links, you're unfocused |
| Process over pitch | Describe how you think, not why they should buy |
| Dual-location | Geographic presence signals market understanding |
