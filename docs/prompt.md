# Project: m.

A personal lab homepage. Anonymous, minimal, letting the work speak. Currently in scaffolding mode — no projects yet, just establishing the mood and vision.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- ShadCN UI

## Routes

Five distinct design directions, each on its own route:
- /1
- /2
- /3
- /4
- /5

## Design Direction

- Minimalist — restraint over noise
- Warm, human, unpretentious
- The "m." signature appears quietly (lowercase, with period)
- Anonymous/mysterious identity
- Structure for future projects, but placeholder content for now

## CTA

Something understated — a simple email link or "say hello" that doesn't demand attention. No forms, no popups. Just a quiet door.

## Creative Brief

The five designs should explore wildly different aesthetics while staying true to the core philosophy. Push the limits of design capabilities — each should be creative and unique from all the others.
